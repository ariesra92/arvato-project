## Project Descriptions<a name = "descriptions"></a>

In this project, I have analyzed demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. I have used unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, I have applied what we had learned on a third dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and used a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company. The data that we will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.
